## A Collection of Apps built with React + Redux

### Video Search App

**TODO:** 
- [ ] Styling fixes

### Weather Forecast App
The 5-Day forecast weather app features integration with Google Maps as well as Open Weather App. Based on a search, it will display relevant weather  for a particular city. Temperature, pressure and humidity charts as well as a map of the city are displayed per row.

### Blog App
The blog web app integrates with a very basic [API](https://github.com/murielg/rest-api) I created for this purpose. It authenticates users, and accepts standard HTTP CRUD requests. The app has a posts list view and a post detail view. 

**TODO:**
- [ ] Finish off blog actions: create new post, fetch individual posts, delete, etc.
- [ ] Polish integration with JSON API, mainly authentication.
- [ ] Styling
